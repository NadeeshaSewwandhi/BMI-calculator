# BMI Tracker – A Machine Learning Web App

## Introduction

The **BMI Tracker** is a web-based application developed using **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **Machine Learning**. It allows users to enter their height and weight to calculate their **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and classify it as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. The application also displays **personalized medical advice** based on the BMI category, helping users understand and improve their health.

##  Implementation Process (Brief)

- Set up a virtual environment and installed required libraries (`Flask`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
- Created a sample dataset with height, weight, and BMI values.
- Trained a **machine learning classifier** to predict BMI categories.
- Saved the trained model using `pickel`.
- Built a **Flask web application** with input form and prediction result page.
- Loaded the model in `app.py` and performed BMI prediction.
- Displayed **category-specific health advice** and visual feedback.
- Designed the front-end using **HTML and CSS** with blur effects and bubble animations.
- Categorized results dynamically changed UI background and advice.
- Managed project using Git and pushed it to GitHub.
